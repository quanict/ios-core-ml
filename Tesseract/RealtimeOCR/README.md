# RealtimeOCR
Realtime OCR with Tesseract and OpenCV, written in Swift.

Idea behind this project is to recreate the iTunes iOS App's gift card code scanner.

## iOS 9 version is hacky! 

### Don't convert to latest Swift version if it asks (It is already converted, don't know why it's comming up). 
**Recommended to Clean (Cmd + Shift + K) the project before building.**

Demo:

This is my first project with OpenCV and Tesseract so any improvements are welcome.
